Jonah likes to say that Amy was his first friend at Northwestern (Amy likes to say the same about him). Walking back to the hostel from Millenium Park, he noticed her Hadaya necklace, she noticed his Kippah, and we both found a way to walk next to each other and strike up a conversation. A short game of Jewish geography ensued and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Breaking the cycle of domestic violence.</p>
                            <p>Family Rescue is a non-profit organization that provides comprehensive support services and shelter for individuals and families who have experienced domestic violence. They have an emergency shelter as well as a residential program for families to receive social, psychological and educational support, housing and legal guidance, and parenting and life management skill development.</p>
                            <p>Amy was introduced to Family Rescue in July 2015 when she worked there as an occupational therapy fieldwork student in their summer camp for kids. She organized groups, like yoga and gardening, that introduced the children to new activities while at the same time practicing and developing important skills, such as turn-taking, problem-solving, and fine and gross motor skills. Now, Amy is back at Family Rescue, leading parenting classes and joint parent-child programming as part of her Albert Schweitzer Fellowship. She loves the women she works with and is proud to be connected to an organization doing the important and difficult work of supporting survivors of domestic violence.</p>

                            <p>Growing Home is Chicago’s leading expert in farm-based training for people with employment barriers. Growing Home provides job experience and job readiness training at their farm in Englewood, an underserved community on the South side of Chicago with extremely high rates of unemployment and poverty and limited access to healthy food choices. In addition to job training skills, Growing Home provides the services and support needed to conquer other issues such as criminal records, medical needs, child-care and housing in order to transform and rejuvenate low-income communities.</p>
                            <p>We first found out about Growing Home when we were looking into different Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) options for the fall after we moved to Chicago. Once we found Growing Home, we immediately fell in love with their mission and signed up! We had a great time cooking with the different veggies from the farm. Last October, we had the chance to visit the farm in Englewood and to meet some of the participants whose lives have been changed by Growing Home. We still follow them and Instagram and hope they'll start up their CSA again soon!</p>

                            <p>St. Leonard’s Ministries is a non-profit organization that serves women and men who have formerly been incarcerated. Residents typically live at St. Leonard’s for about 6 months. During this time, they enroll in classes and meetings, such as high school courses and vocational training, that provide assistance as they transition into successful, independent housing. St. Leonard’s also provides an environment to develop a healthy social support system and the skills necessary to regain their lives.<p>
                            <p>During the spring of 2015, Amy spent 6 weeks working with the men at St. Leonard’s residential program. Along with two of her classmates, she taught a life skills course to the residents, discussing topics with them such as goal setting, healthy eating, and time management. Both of us are committed to working within our fields to support people and organizations trying to fix our broken criminal justice system, and St. Leonard's is one of the organizations doing just that.</p>

                            <h2>Jewish Wedding Rituals</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">We are so grateful that you are joining us in Tampa to celebrate our wedding! Below, we describe some of the Jewish rituals that will happen at our wedding. We envision a vibrant, energy-filled atmosphere with everyone participating, so we hope you’ll join us in the fun!</p>
                            <h3>Tisch</h3>
                            <p>Our wedding celebration will begin with a <i>Tisch</i>, Yiddish for table. We like to think of the <i>tisch</i> as a kind of pep-rally, to build excitement and energy for the main event. Traditionally, this part of the wedding celebration happens with the bride and groom in separate rooms, but we are doing it together. Everyone will gather in the Il Terrazzo room before the ceremony. Jonah and Amy&mdash;who will not have seen each other all day&mdash;will enter separately and meet in the middle of the room, as everyone sings traditional Jewish wedding songs (more on that below). Throughout the <i>tisch</i>, we invite everyone to sing and dance (and drink a little!) to create a raucous, joyful atmosphere. We have asked some friends and family to give us their blessings as we prepare for our ceremony. Jonah will give a short d’var Torah, word of Torah, but will be interrupted by singing, a tradition meant to make the bride and groom smile and calm their nerves.</p>
                            <h3>Ketubah</h3>
                            <p>At the end of the <i>tisch</i>, Jonah and Amy, along with two witnesses, will sign the <i>ketubah</i>, marriage contract, which details the promises we make to one another under the chuppah. Ours is an egalitarian ketubah, which emphasizes our joint commitment to love, respect, and support one another as <i>re’im ahuvim</i>, loving companions, throughout our lives. The original artwork was created by Rani Halpern, a family friend, and it will hang in our home.</p>
                            <h3>Circling</h3>
                            <p>After the <i>tisch</i>, we’ll head upstairs for the ceremony. After the processional, Jonah and Amy will circle each other seven times in silence. This choreography defines the sacred space that encompasses our marriage and sets this moment apart from all that preceded it.</p>
                            <h3>Chuppah</h3>
                            <p>The <i>chuppah</i>, the wedding canopy, represents the home that we will build together as a married couple. It is open on all sides to symbolize that our home will embody hospitality and openness and to remind us of our commitment to constant engagement with the broader community. As we stand under the <i>chuppah</i>, we will be surrounded by our parents and siblings, who taught us what it means to build a loving home and will continue to support us throughout our lives. The roof of our <i>chuppah</i> is a <i>tallit</i>, prayer shawl, that we bought together in Jerusalem and that Jonah will wear after we are married.</p>
                            <h3>Rings</h3>
                            <p>Our rings are a public symbol of our commitment to one another. We’ve chosen to depart from the traditional ritual, in which the ring represents the groom’s purchase of the bride. In our ceremony, we will exchange rings simultaneously to demonstrate that we are equal partners in our marriage.</p>
                            <h3>Sheva Brachot</h3>
                            <p>Traditionally, the bride and groom are showered with <i>sheva brachot</i>, seven blessings, under the chuppah and throughout their first week of marriage. The blessings reflect the joy of loving partnerships since the dawn of humanity. We have asked some of our friends and family to recite the traditional Hebrew blessings and modern English translations. We invite you to sing along during the 6th and 7th blessings.</p><img src="img/sameach.png"><p><i><strong>Sameiach t’samach reim haAhuvim k’sameichakha y’tzirkha b’Gan Eiden mikedem</strong>. Barukh ata Adonai, m’sameiach chatan v’kalah</i></p>
                            <img src="img/asher_bara.png"><p><i>Barukh ata Adonai, Eloheinu melekh haOlam, <strong>asher bara sasson v’simcha, chatan v’kalah,  gilah, rinah,  ditzah v’chedvah,  ahavah v’achavah,  shalom v’reiut</strong>.  M’heira Adonai  Eloheinu yishama  b’arei Yehudah  uv’chutzot Yerushalayim <strong>kol sasson v’kol simcha , kol chatan v’kol kalah </strong> kol mitzhalot chatanim meichupatam une’arim mimishtei n’ginatam. Barukh ata Adonai, m’sameiach  chatan im hakalah.</i></p>
                            <h3>Breaking the Glass</h3>
                            <p>As the finale of the ceremony, we break a glass to remind us&mdash;even in the happiest of moments&mdash;of the continued brokenness of the world and our obligation as a couple to work toward its repair. As you hear the sound of the glass shatter, please shout “Mazel Tov!” to wish us good luck as we begin our marriage.</p>
                            <p>Immediately after, we ask everyone to sing <i>Od Yishama</i> (see below) and dance us from the <i>chuppah</i> to <i>yichud</i>, where we will spend our first moments together as a married couple.<br/><i>Od yishama b'arei Yehudah, uv'chutzot Yerushalayim, kol sason v'kol simcha, kol chatan v'kol kalah!</i><br/>(Note: We’ll sing the first version, which you can hear above under “Jewish Wedding Songs.”)<p>
                            <h3>Hora &amp; Schtick</h3>
                            <p>The first dance of our reception will be the hora, a traditional Jewish celebratory dance. With high energy, clapping, and smiles, everyone will welcome us into the reception room for the first time as a married couple. Then, the hora will start! Join us on the dance floor, grab hands with a friend, and dance in circles to the music of <i>Hava Nagila.</i></p>
                            <p>After a bit of dancing, we will be lifted in chairs (with the support of some strong people), a tradition to celebrate the bride and groom. Once we return safely to the ground, we’ll be seated at the edge of the dance floor for <i>schtick</i>, a Jewish tradition in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom with dancing, costumes, jokes, goofiness, and silliness. It’s considered a <i>mitzvah</i>, or good deed, to make the bride and groom happy on their wedding day. So, bring your best moves, it’s going to be a blast!</p>
                            <h3>Jewish Wedding Songs</h3>
                            <p>These are some of the songs we might sing at the <i>tisch</i>. We will provide song sheets so everyone can sing along. Below are links to listen to if you want to get pumped!</p>
                            <h4>Od Yishama</h4>
                            <p>Perhaps the classic Jewish wedding song. The words of <i>Od Yishama</i> are found in the seventh of the <i>Sheva Brachot</i> (though originally they are from the book of Jeremiah):<br/> 
                            <i>Od yishama b'arei Yehudah, uv'chutzot Yerushalayim, kol sason v'kol simcha, kol chatan v'kol kalah!</i><br/>Translated, it means: “Yet again there shall be heard in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem​ the voice of joy and the voice of gladness,​ the voice of the groo​m and the voice of the bride.”<br/></p>
                            <p>There are several tunes to <i>Od Yishama</i>, but this one is the most popular, and the one we'd like people to sing after we break the glass (we like it at a bit of a brisker pace): (Click the play button to play)<br/><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/Od%20Yishama1.mp3" data-start="4000" data-end="70000" data-plays="1">Od Yishama</span>

                            <p>Here are some other songs we might sing!</p>
                            <h4>Siman Tov</h4>
                            <p><i>Siman tov u'mazal tov yeheh lanu, u’lchol yisrael</i><br/>Translation: May auspicious signs and good luck be with us and all of Israel</p>
                            <h4>Yasis Alayich</h4>
                            <p><i>Yasis alayich elohaich kimsos chatan al kallah</i><br/>Translation: Your God shall rejoice over you, as a groo​​m rejoices over his bride.<br/>
                            <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/YasisAlayich.mp3" data-start="23000" data-end="71000" data-plays="1">Yasis Alayich</span>
                            <h4>Atah Takum</h4>
                            <p><i>Atah Takum, t'rachem tziyon, ki et l'chenanah ki va moed</i><br/>Translation: You shall arise, and have compassio​n upon Zion; for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed​ time has come.</p>
                            <h4>Sameach</h4>
                            <p><i>Sameach te'samach re’im ahuvim, k'samechacha yetzircha b'gan eden mi'kedem.</i><br/>Translation: Let the loving couple be very happy, just as you made your creation happy in the garden of eden, so long ago.</p>
